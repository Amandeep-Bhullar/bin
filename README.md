# Student "bin" scripts

## Project folder

After cloning this repository, to create and launch a project folder from the command line interface:

### From the `bin` folder
```
source project.sh *[project-name]*
```

### Aliasing the command as `project`:
```
alias project='source *[path-to-folder]*/project.sh'
```

To have the above `alias` persist for each login, add the command above to your `.zshrc` (or `.bashrc`) file, usually found in your user's home directory (`~`).
